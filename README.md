# fyberapi

Communication with the server has been problematic.
There is a flag in FyberAPI which can be set true to enable mocking
of the http response (set via setMockedResponse).
Set this to 'false' to enable actual communication
with the server, which is currently serving up a complaint about
bad timestamps to all requests.
